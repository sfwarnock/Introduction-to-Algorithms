Lecture 3 | MIT 6.00 Into to CS

- Data            Operations            Commands
Num             +, *                  Assignment
Strings         and, or               input/output
Booleans                            conditionals
                                    loop mechanisms (while)

- Good Progamming Style
Use comments
Type disipline
Decsriptive use of variable names
Branch testing

- Iteative Program Steps
1. choose variable that is going to count
2. initialize outside the loop
3. set-up and test (end test)
4. construct block of code 
  4.1 change variable
5. what to do when done

- Flow charts for program design

Lecture 4 | MIT 6.00 Into to CS

We have   Turring Complete
  Assignment
  Conditonals
  input/output
  looping constructs (for/loop)
  
We dont have
  Decomposition - way of structure onto the code
  Abstraction - suppress details, treat comuption like a black box
  
Functions
  break-up into modules
  suppress detail
  create 'new primitives'
