#   Input: A sequence of n numbers A = [a1, a2,....an] and a value v.

#   Output: An index i such that v = A[i] or the special value NIL if v does not appear in A.

#   Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking for v.
#   Using a loop invariant, prove the your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your
#   loop invariant fullfills the three necessary properties.
