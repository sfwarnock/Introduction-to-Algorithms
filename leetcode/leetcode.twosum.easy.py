# LeetCode Two Sum

# Given an array of integers, return indices of the two nubmers such that they add up to a specific target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

# Example:

#   given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9

#   because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9
#   return [0,1]

def sumTwo(a, target):
    i = 1
    j = a[i]
    k = target - j

    print(i, j, k)

            
target = 22
a = [2, 7, 11, 15, 45]
